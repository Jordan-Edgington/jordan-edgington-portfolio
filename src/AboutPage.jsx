            <p className='text-center font-serif m-4'>Prior to becoming a software developer, I spent 6 years as a signals intelligence analyst in the US Air Force. Being a signals analyst was intriguing, but I wanted to make stuff, not analyze it. I decided to get out of the military and pursue a career in software. As part of my separation process, I discovered Code Platoon (a 15-week full-stack software development bootcamp), through the skillbridge program. I was accepted into the Whiskey Cohort, and studied with Code Platoon from January to May of 2024. </p>

            <p className='text-center font-serif m-4'>During the bootcamp, I learned what it takes to be a full-stack software developer. The following languages and frameworks are tools I have learned: </p>
